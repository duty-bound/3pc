## Restrictions

I could not open the '.sketch' file so colors, dimensions, spacing, etc., are based on my best guess.

The instructions are in German, I had to do with a Google translation. Please let me know if my work missed some requirement.


## The App

The button on screen 1 receives focus when the app loads. Hitting 'space' is equivalent to clicking the button.

If the Close button recieves focus, it can be triggered by pressing either 'Space' or 'Enter'.

The user can tab through the categories by pressing 'tab'.

Decreasing the size of the screen changes the layout, but retains this functionality.


## The Mobile App

The code used to detect whether the device is a mobile or not is not the best, but for this example it does the job.

The mobile app uses clicks, since no hovering is possible.

Not much time was consumed on making the mobile app look aesthetically better; but certaianly improvements can be made.

## add test
## add Esc to close overlay
